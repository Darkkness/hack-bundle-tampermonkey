	<h3>Here are the cheats</h3>
	<small>Apr. 15, 2018</small>
	<p>If you can read this, the cheat was loaded up. Good job spies, you made it.</p>
	<p>In game you can now open <span class="highlight_help">Esc</span>-menu and find out new buttons. That's cheat functions. Everything is toggled on by default.</p>
	<p>If something isn't working, make sure you are using Chrome. If cheat stops working just open ONE github issue and do not create duplicate issues.</a> Also, <a href="https://discord.gg/HUktXMe" target="_blank">here's our Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLff8YzqQ-vIAFTKPTDz3RA?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube.</a></p>
